# DSA Quick Reference

This is a quick **Data Structure and Algorithms** reference guide with examples based on the _Python 3_ programming language.

If you have come here, you are probably preparing for an interview, or just want to review some material before participating to a _coding competition_. Either way, I hope you enjoy that collection of material and make good use of it.

I usually collect notes in a much more elegant way using my favorite pens, a _Moleskin_, drawing everything by hand. But if you have to travel, it can be useful to have everything available in one repository.

There are a lot of similar documents, some of them really complete, that you will find in the reference section. I know a question will arise in your mind: why bother writing another one. Well, I am a great fan of "_review by doing it again_" philosophy, and I encourage you of doing the same because you really understand something when you try to explain it to someone else.

Currently, this document is a work in progress and will soon reach a sufficient level of completeness, although the ultimate intention is to provide guidance for reviewing concepts you are already familiar with, so it will never be a comprehensive source of information.

For more information on the topics, I have found some books and courses that could be useful to you, and that you will find in the references section at the bottom.
