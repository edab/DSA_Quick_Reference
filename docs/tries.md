# Tries

A **Trie**, pronounced "try" and also known as a **Prefix Tree**, is an tree representing a collection of string with one node per common prefix, and each edge labeled with a character $c$.

Unlike a _Binary Search Tree (BST)_, no node store the key and multiple child are possible, potentially one for each letter of the alphabet.

Tries were first described by RenÃ© de la Briandais in 1959, and are an efficient solution to problem related to string like:

- functions that provides spell checking
- functions that provides auto complete
- functions for find the _longest_ something in a string
  - _longest_ repeated substring in a sequence
  - _longest_ common substring in a sequence
  - _longest_ palindrome in a string
  - _longest_ common prefixes within two suffixes
- solve computational biology problems, where a gene is a long sequence of characters from the set _{ATGC}_, which represent the nucleic acid sequence of proteins.
- data storage and compression (like the _block-sorting compression_)

A alternative way to solve that type of problems can involve _hashmaps_ for storing all the words, and in that case, we will have a _time complexity_ of $O(1)$ for searching a word, and a _space complexity_ of $O(m*n)$, where `m` is the length of the word, and `n` is the number of words.

The basic idea behind the _Trie_ data structure is that many different words share a _common prefix_, so why not save it once? We can then definitely improve space complexity saving prefix only one time, while sacrificing a little on performance.

As an example, just think about four different words to store inside the _Trie_: `consider`, `consist`, `confident`, `confirm`. The _Trie_ structure in that case can be represented as this:

Each node preserve its children into a data structure that allows after to search if the next character is present or not. There are two common implementation, one use an _Array_ with a fixed size of 26, where each element represent a character of the alphabet and point eventually to a child, or a _Hash Map_ with a (char, next_node) pairs.

## Complexity

The _time complexity_ of this data structure, if `K` is the length of the string to insert or search, would be $O(K)$. For _space complexity_, if $N$ is the total number of nodes and $M$ is the size of the alphabet will be $O(N * M)$.

## Usage

### Tries as substrings offsets maps

We can create a _Trie_ that maps substrings to offsets where they occur, if we add to the node a list of indexes, for solving computational biology problems. Suppose we should analyze the following sequence:

$CTGTTACCGTACTTATAGCTCCTT$

We can identify the gene sequences and their corresponding indexes:

Substing | Index
:-- | :--
AC | 10
AG | 16
AT | 14
CC | 6
CC | 20
CT | 0
CT | 18
GT | 2
GT | 8
TA | 4
TT | 12
TT | 22

And we can create the following _Trie_:

## Practice question

- ***Longest prefix matching***: Given a dictionary of words and an input string, find the longest prefix of the string which is also a word in dictionary.
- ***Pattern matching***: Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
- ***Longest prefix matching***: Given a dictionary of words and an input string, find the longest prefix of the string which is also a word in dictionary.

## Implementations

### Basic Trie using dictionary

We can create for this data structure a simple _character node_ that contains two attributes: a _bool_ value that indicate the end of a word, and a _dict_ that holds any child letters that may com after it in a string.

A cleaner way to do that is using a `DefaultDict`, that in case the key is not available will return a default value.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class TrieNode:

  def __init__(self):
    self.is_word = False
    self.children = defaultdict(TrieNode)

class Trie:

  def __init__(self):
    self.root = TrieNode()

  def insert(self, word):
    curr_node = self.root
    for char in word:
      curr_node = curr_node.children[char]
    curr_node.is_word = True

  def search(self, word):
    curr_node = self.root
    for char in word:
      if char not in curr_node.children:
        return False
      curr_node = curr_node.children[char]
    return curr_node.is_word
```

### Basic Trie using an array of characters

Another common implementation of a _Trie_ use an array of 26 elements, one for each letter, instead of the `dict()`.

```python
class TrieNode:

    def __init__(self):
        self.children = [None] * 26
        self.is_word = False

class Trie:

    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def _char_to_index(self, ch):
        """
        Converts lower case char into index starting from 'a'
        """
        return ord(ch) - ord('a')

    def insert(self, key):
        curr_node = self.root
        for level in range(len(key)):
            index = self._char_to_index(key[level])
            if not curr_node.children[index]:
                curr_node.children[index] = TrieNode()
            curr_node = curr_node.children[index]
        curr_node.is_word = True

    def search(self, key):
        curr_node = self.root
        for level in range(len(key)):
            index = self._char_to_index(key[level])
            if not curr_node.children[index]:
                return False
            curr_node = curr_node.children[index]
        return curr_node != None and curr_node.is_word
```
