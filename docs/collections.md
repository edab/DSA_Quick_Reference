# Collections

**Collection** are data structures that group items that have some shared attributes and need to be manipulated using common operations.

Generally speaking, all collection shares some property:

- Elements of a collection don't need to have a particular order.
- Elements of a collection can be of different types.

Since normal arrays hold a fixed amount of date items, they are not considered part of collections, although variable-size arrays are.

There are different types of collections:

- **Linear collections**: they define a particular order that will affect the way you can access to the elements.
  - Linked lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Priority queues
  - Deques (Double ended queues)
  - Double ended priority queues
- **Associative collections**: they are composed by collections of (key, value) pairs.
  - Sets
  - Multisets
  - Associative arrays (map, dictionary, lookup table)
- **Graphs**: data items have associations with one or more other data items in the collections.
  - Graphs
  - Trees
